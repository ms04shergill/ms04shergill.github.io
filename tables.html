    <td>White House Down</td>
    <td>White House Down is a action packed thriller of a movie which stars Jamie Foxx and Channing Tatum. The movie is basically about how a terrorist takes over the most secured and protected building in the world. The group that takes over the White House absolutely dispises the presdient of the United States because of the decisons he made in the middle east. In conclusion is one of my favourite movies because it is exciting and funny at some parts.  </td>
